NAME
    Acme::UNIVERSAL::cannot - Just so that Acme::LOLCat->cannot('has')

SYNOPSIS
        use Acme::UNIVERSAL::cannot;
        use Acme::LOLCat; # Should be fixed in 0.0.5 hopefully.

        Acme::LOLCat->cannot('has');
        Acme::LOLCat->can't('has');
        Acme::LOLCat->cant('has');

BLAME
    ElPenguin made me do it.

    Nicholas Clark suggested "->can't()"
